title: "Welcome to my Strudel" date: 2025-01-30

Today I was in hall putting my shoes on and I saw a Strudel hiding behind a bookshelf, it was peering out waiting for me to leave the house. 
I pretended to not see it and walk past towards the front door, then leaping back to catch it with my foot before it could scuttle back behind the bookshelf.
These Strudels are everywhere.
I'm glad i caught and ate this one but I think my work here has just begun.
